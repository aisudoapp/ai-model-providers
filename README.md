## LLM Provider Configurations
[Claude 3 by Anthropic](https://github.com/aisudoapp/ai-model-providers/tree/main/providers/anthropic)


## Folder & File Naming
```
providers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄprovider-name
|	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ chat-completion (for specific model)
|	‚îÇ   cc-base.json
|	‚îÇ   tti-base.json
|	‚îÇ   README.md
‚îÇ
```

- cc = Chat Completions
- tti = Text to Image

For most case, the 'base.json' is enough.  
  
The README.md also served as model information.

## Limitations
- Currently, for the 3rd party models, AiSudo only support chat completions. We are working to expand our capabilities in the future.
- When using the model listed in this repository, you can ignore the request rate limit on your aisudo account, that limit is only for our official models.
- Request rate limits are dependent on the 3rd party provider and may vary. We recommend checking the provider's website for the most up-to-date information on request rates.
- The downside of using the 3rd party json is: you can't use AiSudo preset and language selection.


## Privacy

We do not collect or store any data sent to third-party providers. Any data exchanged with these providers is not retained or saved in our database, ensuring that your information remains private and secure.
